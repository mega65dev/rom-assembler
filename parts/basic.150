; STRLT2 takes the string literal whose first character is pointed to by 
; (xreg)+1 and builds a descriptor for it.  The descriptor is initially 
; built in DSCTMP, but PUTNEW transfers it into a temporary and leaves a 
; pointer to the temporary in FACMO & FACLO.  The characters other than the 
; zero that terminates the string should be set up in CHARAC and ENDCHR. 
; If the terminator is a quote, the quote is skipped over.  Leading quotes 
; should be skipped before call.  On return, the character after the string 
; literal is pointed to by (strng2).
