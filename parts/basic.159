; FRETMP is passed a string descriptor pntr in (a,y).  A check is made to see 
; if the string descriptor points to the last temporary descriptor allocated by 
; putnew.  If so, the temporary is freed up by the updating of (temppt).  If a 
; string is freed up, a further check sees if it was the last one created and if 
; so, (fretop) is updated to reflect the fact that the space is no longer in use. 
; The address of the actual string is returned in (x,y) and its length in (a).
