; LINGET  Reads a line # from the current txtptr position
;   and stores it in linnum  (valid range is 0-63999).
;
;   On exit txtptr is pointing to the terminating char
;   which is in .a with condition codes set.
;   Endchr will be =0 if no digit input, else >0.  Use it
;   to distinguish between line # 0 & null input.
